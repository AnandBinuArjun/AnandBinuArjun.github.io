# Deploying UI/UX Guide to Subdirectory

## Steps to deploy to your existing AnandBinuArjun.github.io site:

1. Create a new folder named `ui-ux-guide` in your `AnandBinuArjun.github.io` repository
2. Copy all files from this deploy folder to the new `ui-ux-guide` subdirectory
3. Commit and push to GitHub
4. Access your guide at `https://AnandBinuArjun.github.io/ui-ux-guide/`

## Integration with your main site:

The navigation has been updated to link back to your main site:
- Logo in header links to `../` (your main site)
- Added "Home" link in journey.html that goes to your main site

## Customization:

You can further customize:
1. Update the footer links to match your social profiles
2. Modify the color scheme in styles.css if desired
3. Add your own content to the pages

The guide will maintain its standalone functionality while being accessible as part of your portfolio.
